                    Also called (Lindy, not Charleston) &quot;open doors&quot;, is one of the most basic moves there is.
                    To indicate it, first externally rotate a bit with the whole body, but only on the y-axis through the spine, don't bend the upper body; stay upright.
                    This creates a stretch in the arm through the frame, so don't push only with your arm/hand directly, as this will create an uncomfortable, sharp sensation.
                    The follower has as well a small stretch in the shoulder through the hand which is placed on the leader's shoulder blade.
                    Push the followers back a bit, and then both half-turn 180 degrees towards each other, &quot;opening their wings&quot;.<br/>
                    Try to start with left and right leg, as well as clockwise and counter-clockwise.<br/>
                    This is usually done in 8-count basic, as it is not really possible to do it (continuously) in 6-count, as the necessary rock-step is missing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The classical butterfly/open doors is done in the closed-position, whereas sometimes we do it for bigger movements (think of <a href="#Basics_Positioning_Franky6">Franky 6</a>).
                    We turn and push our partner into (subsequent) rotations by moving our whole body (don't push from the arms/hands).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is a nice possibility to <b>switch roles</b>, by putting the leader's arm on top (and on the closer shoulder blade) instead underneath the follower's arm.

                    A send-out is basically moving from closed- to open-position, with either leader or follower in front.
                    We could therefore also call the opposite move, from closed- to open-position, a &quot;send-in&quot;
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>To send out the <b>follower</b>, the leader stays on the spot and does a rock-step to the side (or slightly back), rotating the torso towards the follower (CW). With this movement, a stretch/bounce can be created, and with the right arm connected to the frame, an elastic push can be generated.</li>
                    <li>Slightly pull with your left hand and push with your right to rotate the follower and make her step in front of you. Again: Stay on your spot, otherwise she will have difficulties traveling!</li>
                    <li>Watch out: The second rock-step is done backwards (staying on the spot!), and not as usually to the front. Also for the follower: Don't travel too far but maintain the right distance, adjust the steps, as otherwise the stretch on the rock-step is going to over-stretch (losing the frame).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The <b>leader</b> send-out is done by first indicating to the follower to stay on the spot (otherwise tricky traveling far), and then move in front.
                    Continue with the basic-step or move back again to a side-by-side position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <b>variation</b> of it includes a turn CW, by pushing the follower's left side of the back, which might come a bit counter-intuitive and as a surprise at first.

                    We both, usually, turn CW, as it is easier.
                    The hand-connection is possible, but not necessary.
                    The rock-steps are only regular steps and not really shifting the weight fully backward/forward.
                    On those, also most of the circle motion happening.<br/>
                    <i>Both</i> really have to move around a pivot point between them, not just one is moving around the other.
                    We give each other counter-balance, so shift your weight really back, with the butt (requires some core strength) and not with upper-body only.
                    Touch each other's shoulder blade, not the waist, and don't grab or pull there; the follower has also a strong connection to the frame through the arm here (valid in general, but here especially).<br/>
                    If you get dizzy, simply do it a bit more, as more practice will get your body used to it, and it'll improve over time.

                    Practice the entering and exit properly, as this might pose the biggest difficulty.
                    Enter on the rock-step and already start to turn your follower, providing some space for her and indicating early enough what's about to come.<br/>
                    After 8 counts, a 360-degree circle should be completed, and the last triple-steps should be pulled straight back (not rotational anymore) to go back into basic, facing in the original direction.
                    Alternatively, a <b>release</b> into the open position is possible and from there immediately back into the circle.

                    You can make it a bit more &quot;spicy&quot; by adding a tuck turn from within the circle.
                    Watch out to switch shortly into a 6-count-basic for the duration of the tuck turn and then back into a 8-counta gain.
