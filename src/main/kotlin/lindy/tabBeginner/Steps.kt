                    We usually step something we call &quot;quick&quot; (one beat) or &quot;slow&quot; (two beats).
                    The slow-step (also called <i>groove-walk</i>) is a simplified version of the triple-step.
                    The quick-steps come in pairs, also called &quot;<i>rock-steps</i>&quot;.
                    The stepping pattern comes in two flavors: 6-count and 8-count.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keep a <b>bounce</b> and bend the (soft) knees, relax your arms, breathe, and look forward (not down).
                    For the slow-step (without triples) we do two bounces (connect to the music).<br />
                    Slightly <b>lean forward</b> with your upper body, and also keep most of the weight on the front part of the foot.
                    The heels hover a tiny bit over the ground, using the achilles tendon to bounce.<br />
                    <b>Turn</b> your direction while doing the basic step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dance is done from the center, the core, the pelvis area, and not from the legs or arms.
                    When doing the rock-step, initiate it by your center, really shifting your weight and moving the whole body as a unit.
                    Don't just move your legs and keep the rest of the body in the same position.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When in closed position, we always start with outer leg.
                    When in open position, the leg starts where the hands are holding.
                    Put differently: &quot;<i>Leader always starts left, because follower is always right.</i>&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    Technically, we can differentiate between a linear and a <b>rotational rock-step</b> (not circular).
                    The first is the default, whereas the second is used for rotating, to send out the follower, to give her a bit of a spin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tip on how to <b>indicate starting</b>: Of course, keep the bounce, and additionally to that shift the weight medial, so the follower's outer leg is free. Take a deep breath in, lift your center up, and once you want to go, breathe out and lower in a U-shape backwards to make it crystal clear.<br/>
                    Or when starting in open position, first go down a bit, like in a U-shape, then go back and push arm forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the basic steps (6-count, 8-count) there is surprisingly much to do already, which requires a very good connection between the partners to properly communicate the changes (this is already rather advanced).
                    The combination of repeaters and walks (single steps/groove-walk, or triples), 6/8-count and closed/open-position alone can be combined in complex patterns.
                </p>

                    <b>Exercise:</b><br/>
                    Stand in front of each other without any touch, and try to synchronize each other's movement with visual cues only, reading the body language and emphasizing shift weight and leaning. Introduce some breaks and repeaters, maybe even switch count steps or triples and grooves and enjoy the ride.

                    The <b>triple-step</b> is done in a &quot;W-shape&quot; not M; meaning: Going down into the ground, not upwards; actually with all our steps, as they keep a bounce into the ground.
                    Try to keep standing on the spot (or deliberately &quot;travel&quot;), letting the grove go vertical downwards, and don't move sideways.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The triple is done on a so-called &quot;<i>syncopated rhythm</i>&quot; (syncopation = a disturbance/interruption of the regular flow of music).
                    To put it simply: Three steps done within two beats, whereas the second step in the middle is a bit delayed and closer to the third.
                    The two beats indeed also have two bounces.<br/>
                    Because it squeezes multiple steps into a short timeframe, the triple-step can only be done on slower songs; for faster ones we need to use the groove-walk again.

                <p>Simply repeating the same stepping parts on the (semi) spot. For this, it is crucial to have a good, strong connection with your partner: Follower's elbow pushed inwards, leader's embrace harm tight; don't be shy to give a clear push/pull.<br/>
                    Different possibilities are available:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While being at the <b>back/rock-step</b> (open position), instead of a slow-step, stay on the spot and hover the leg in front.</li>
                    <li>While being at the <b>front/5-6</b> (open position), repeat the quick-quick-steps. The outer leg stays on the spot still is lifted a bit when the weight is shifted off; and the inner leg constantly moves back and forth (no slow-step). To stop the repeater, make the back-step quick-step into a slow-step. Also, while the repeater-quick-step keeps the more to the front, and the leader is being given a slight impulse forward ("stop"), when stopping, the whole body is moved backwards, and an impulse to move backwards is given ("go").</li>
                    <li>While being in the <b>closed position</b>, we do a similar step pattern as with being in the front open position. Be clear as a leader to "zap" at the edges with your arms, and to rotate the partner back in to go back to the open position. Here either <b>leader or follower</b> in front will change how steps and who stays.</li>
                    <li>There are also <b>oppositions</b> where we go counter back-and-forth, yet with the same quality of repeaters.</li>
                </ul>

                    When the music is not playing (it has a break), we can stand still on the spot.
                    We do so at the back-most position (stay on the back-leg, the second doing a quick-step), and indicate by being upright with the upper body (instead of leaning forward).

                    Just grooving around in some walks (bounce every, and step every second beat), basic steps, doing simple repeaters (when front or back) and breaks, switching 6- and 8-count basic, and also switching triples and grove-walks; just no fancy technical moves.
                    It is used to find/connect to the song and each other, at the beginning of a dance, especially when dancing with a new and unknown partner.
                    It can also be useful as a recovery strategy; a way to (re)start.
