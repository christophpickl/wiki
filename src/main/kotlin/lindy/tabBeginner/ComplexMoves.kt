                    It's similar to a send-out (also a bit butterfly), but with less of a push, less distance and more connection.
                    We will first cover the version where the follower goes first, as the leader can also go first, just like a send-out, where the leader walks backwards first and then pulls the follower back in.

                    The wrapped leader's arm stays on the follower's back while changing position.
                    The follower's arm moves from the back onto the upper arm with a kind of a &quot;dragon mouth open hand&quot;, thus creating a <i>shared frame</i> (a construct across two bodies), to maintain the distance and push lead a bit so not to collide.<br/>
                    With the second rock-step, both continue walking in the same direction (of the follower, which walks backwards), and with the triple-step the leader quickly jumps next to the follower's side.

                    The shortened variation, in our school named <b>promenot</b> (as of: not doing the promenade), is pulled back after the first rock-step forward in the open position.
                    It's interrupted by this pull back with the typical stretch-sensation.

                    Done in the 6-count basic, starting similar to a regular follower send-out, and with a ballroom hand position.
                    The first (rotational) rock-step is stepped slightly diagonally back, not straight back (creating too much of a rotational-stretch and disconnection of lower and upper body), and also not anywhere forward (potentially misinterpreted by follower for a swing out).
                    The leader turns towards the follower, pushing the follower turning away (CW) creating a stretch.
                    For that, separate the lower and upper body: The upper body rotates while the pelvis stays facing forward, creating suspension which can be released to turn.
                    Then pulling her back inwards again (CCW) which happens less from the back arm, maybe a bit, but mostly through the (firm) LEGO-shaped hand connection.
                    stopping her with a hand-compression on the first triple-step (lots of time there).<br/>
                    On the 2nd triple-step (less time here), let her walk under your lifted arm, creating a window, by turning her to the other direction and giving a slight push with the right hand on the left side of the back.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You will either have to change hand-positions (hopefully there is no tight grip between them to enable a rolling point of contact) while turning to end up in the common hand-position during the open-position, or alternatively: Do another turn immediately to &quot;fix&quot; it, either change places or do a send-in back to the closed-position.<br/>
                    Yet another possibility is to right away switch into crossed hands (leader from left to right hand) and go into a <a href="#Basics_Positioning_Franky6">Franky 6</a>.

                    The tuck turn can also be done in the <b>8-count basic</b>, which requires the follower to turn two times (or any times necessary to get back into the pattern).
                    As long as the arm stays up, the follower will keep on spinning; thus, don't lower it!
                    Also don't &quot;stir&quot; with your hand, pushing your follower, simply keep it up, and maybe follow with your hand a bit the movement.
                    Once the follower is almost at the correct position (facing right), lower your hand and catch the next rock-step again.

                1) rotate inwards, rotational rock-step, left elbow pushes into follower
                2) rotate outwards again (similar like with butterfly)
                3) rotate inwards again, release (as leader) right hand and put it on followers' left shoulder blade

                <p>
                    Starting from crossed-hand open-position, using 6-count basic.
                    Instead of the leader's regular linear rock-step, now do a rotational rock-step, pushing the right shoulder forward making the follower turn.
                    Now pull the right arm up, let the follower go underneath it, yet the leader moves most of the distance, ending with his back towards the follower's front.
                    The leader has his right arm on this back, offering his left (palm facing forward) to the follower to hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From this position, there are three steps: One, rotate inwards with a rotational rock-step, and push with the left elbow into the follower.
                    Two, rotate outwards again, similar to Butterfly. Lastly, rotate inwards again, release the right and and put it on the follower's left shoulder blade.
