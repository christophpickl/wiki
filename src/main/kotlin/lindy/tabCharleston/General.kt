                    Charleston is embedded within Lindy Hop, its footwork, and has its own set of techniques, but is capable of being danced to way faster songs.
                    It is a cardio workout, includes lots of core work, and thus, you are going to sweat a lot (bring addition shirts).
                    At the same time, you can also dance it very efficiently, by kicking and stepping smaller.<br/>

                <p>
                    Always keep your upper body <b>bent</b> forward, hinge from pelvis, and still your chest straight upright; there is lots of core work there. The <b>connection</b> is really important, not only to convey intention, but also to keep synchronized with the bounce and movement: The leader having her tight around the waist, the follower push slightly with the arm down (no gap).<br/>
                    There are many <b>styling</b> possibilities, like throwing your arms, the direction of the kicks, rotation of the pelvis, and movements of the upper body. At least keep your arms moving as you do while walking, and don't keep the hanging like dead fish.
                    Especially when you dance solo, feel free to decorate and express even more (taking more space, throwing more).
                    When dancing with a partner, watch out not to kick him, or other people when there is little space around you, are doing a close-proximity technique like the <i>Tandem</i> move.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Always begin by <b>pulsing</b> (instead of big bouncing) and syncing with your partner, getting sure whether you both are hearing the same music.
                    As with Lindy, the leader starts with <b>left leg</b>, the follower with her right.
                    Also, keeping the pulse throughout will make things much easier, as the body goes in some sort of autopilot.
                    Keep on hopping with every kick, every hold and every step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We first have a look at the <b>8-count</b> basic (as with Lindy, there also exists a 6-count).
                    The <b>pattern</b> is as follows: rock step (1+2) - kick step (3+4) - kick (5) - hold (6) - kick back (7) - step (8)<br/>
                    The kick is not really a kick, but more a release/drop after bending the knee, and thus is rather relaxed.
                    This kick is also really done on one leg kick, with a short midair moment of both feet, and then step; it takes more dynamic/explosive energy, so don't get too lazy ;)

                    Some advice on how to dance Charleston a bit more energy efficient:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Make smaller steps.</li>
                    <li>Lean your upper body forward.</li>
                    <li>Keep your feet on the ground while kicking.</li>
                    <li>Only release from the knee, instead of a full-blown kick motion.</li>
                </ul>

                    This technique is usually called hand-to-hand (or is the open doors the regular facing into the same, and the hand-to-hand where facing opposite directions?), which has two versions: One where both are facing the same, or the other direction.
                    The basic footwork consists of: kick - hold/turn - kick - step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To enter the move, you need to simply turn on the hold-step (2nd kick to the front), and indicate clearly to the follower by creating a bit more distance, change your body posture, but most importantly, move the hand on the closer side of the body.<br/>
                    The other version is entered by the leader staying in the same direction for one kick (doing a simple <i>repeater</i>) and from there only an arm/hand/wrist stretch while keeping the turns alive.

                    A variation (or a little spice to add) would be to turn 540 degrees (one-and-a-half turn) and then find each other's hands again. See the second video below for a demonstration of how that could look like.
