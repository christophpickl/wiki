SPIRALS // connecting points
* Stand still, and have your partner touch with each of his index fingers a point on different body parts.
    * do so for at least 3 seconds, and push rather firmly, in order to leave a phantom sensation behind (tactile residue)
* choose one point as the starting point
    * visual a connecting line between the 2 points (it can be within the body, going in curves, or even outside the body)
    * use spiral movements to spiral around that line
* don't hesitate to also play with different planes to inspire new movement patterns in your partner
* (also possible to do it with waves)
