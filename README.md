Wikis/cheatsheets/a place to collect notes, using KotlinJS.

See: https://christophpickl.github.io/wiki/

# TODOs

* favicon for wiki landing page
* delayed load of youtube videos - only when "being viewed"
* better (transparent) favicons
* migrate content of old psywiki; set a "manual redirect"
* multiplatform (official way) doesn't work, but oldschool JS does?! ''kotlin("multiplatform") version "2.0.21"''
